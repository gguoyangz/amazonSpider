We got a brand new never taken out of the box iPhone 6 I was pleasantly surprised.  It works great, the battery lasts a lot longer than his iphone7 that just recently crashed, and it was in pristine condition!  What more could you ask for!?! Not to mention, the T-Mobile provider (or whatever sub-brand service of T-Mobile) has great super cheap options for plans!  I was excited when I called to set it up hearing they had a $25 plan with unlimited talk text and 3Gs of data!  I don’t know ANY service with that cheap of service!!  I’m so glad I trusted amazon and bought this phone because it’s exactly what we needed!!!", "help_num": "9 people found this helpful"}

When we tried clicking the “ABC/123”button on the keyboard, and the “1/Q” button it wouldn’t work. We had apps on the second page of the home screen and it wouldn’t let us drag the apps to the left to move them to the first page. I called Amazon to inform them of the issue and they transferred me to an Apple representative. After having me download the lastest update and resetting the phone, it still wasn’t working properly. Apple said I could either send the phone to them to be repaired or take it to a local Apple store to be fixed. They scheduled me an appointment that evening with Geek Squad at my local Best Buy, since the closest Apple store was a couple hours away. Geek Squad was very friendly, and replaced the screen on my phone within 2 hours, which fixed the problem of not being able to touch the left side of the screen. It’s a really nice phone and everything works perfectly now. It didn’t cost me anything to have the screen replaced, so even though it was an inconvenience to take it to get fixed, I’m happy they were able to fix it and that it only took a couple hours to get the phone back. I bought this phone for my daughter, because she likes using my iPhone 7, and she absolutely loves this phone. When she is playing Minecraft, the phone loads fast and doesn’t lag, which is what made us decide to purchase a new phone.", "help_num": 0}

N fact, as a knowledgeable tech guy, I found Apple’s approach and evaluation superficial, definitely NOT confidence-building. The phone still doesn’t work. A multi-hundred dollar piece of junk. You’d be nuts to buy this phone and, I suspect, any iPhone. You pay more upfront and you pay more in the longer run.  Unless you get lucky with your Chinese gear.
